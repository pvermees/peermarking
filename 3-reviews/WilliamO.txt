1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

- The abstract stays well within the 500 word limit (word limit 472).

- The abstract concentrates and condenses the material presented within the lecture very well.

- Passive voice is used here and should be avoided when writing an abstract.

- I find there's insufficient variation in sentence length. Sentences here are too long and can easily be shortened.

- The text can be easily understood and the content is articulated well in this piece.

- The abstract concentrates and condenses the material presented within the lecture very well.

- The abstract begins with enticing and compelling short sentence.

- Sentence length varies throughout the abstract.

- The text is just above the 500 word limit.

- The abstract is easy to understand and doesn't try to overcomplicate the content discussed during the lecture.

- The content of the lecture in this abstract is broken into parts and each part is explained in each paragraph separately. This helps simplify the content discussed in the lecture.

- The abstract stays well within the 500 word limit (word limit 403). However, given the word count is well below the word limit, it might be seen that the piece is too short and more information is required. 

- The abstract concentrates and condenses all the material presented within the lecture very well.

- The abstract begins with enticing and compelling short sentence.

- I find there's sufficient variation in sentence length.

- Paragraphs are unfortunately not included. This would've helped in breaking down The content of the lecture into parts with each part being explained separately. This would have helped simplify the content being discussed.

- Word count was above the 500 word limit (total word count 548)

- Most of the essential information that was discussed in the lecture was presented in the text. However, I find that the abstract does not mention how to make an effective research poster and presentation.

- I find that the concluding paragraph was unnesessary. The whole point of an abstract is to summarise the content of the paper or in this case the lecture. So creating a concluding summery of the summery is repetitive, only wastes time and adds to the word count. 

- The text overall reads very well, can be understood quite well and has sufficient variation in sentence length. I particularly liked the short poignant sentence at the beginning which immediately draws the attention of the reader. 

- The content of the lecture in this abstract is broken into parts and each part is explained in each paragraph separately. This helps simplify the content discussed in the lecture.

- The abstract stays well within the 500 word limit.

- The concluding part of the text I found unnecessary as the whole point of the abstract  is to summarise the content of the lecture rather than give out ones opinions on the quality of the lecture.

- Passive voice is used here and should be avoided when writing an abstract.

- Most of the essential information that was discussed in the lecture was presented in the text. However, I find that the abstract does not provide enough detail on the outline of scientific papers and doesn't mention how to make an effective research poster and presentation. 

- Some parts of the texts I followed quite well however some parts I found difficult to understand. 

- I found there was sufficient variation in the sentence length. However, one or two sentences where unnecessary as they where more or less a repetition with other sentences being a bit vague. 

- In the third paragraph the author seems to be listing the content from 1 to 3 on how to make an effective graphic. I think this should be best avoided as it creates the impression of jumping from one point to another with no clear flow to the writing. I think this confuses the reader.
