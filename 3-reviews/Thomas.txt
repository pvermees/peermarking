This submission is a good summery of the lecture, with most key points covered. There is a particular emphasis on the importance of effective communication strategies, such as importance of a well-constructed abstract and title, with Landes 1951 cited to emphasis the point. The text is slightly over the 500-word limit, but not sufficiently so to penalise. Some sentences were a little on the long side, which interrupted the flow of the piece especially when read out loud, but there was some effort to vary sentence length throughout. Overall, a good piece of work.

A good summery of all key points of the lecture. Good writing structure in scientific work is highlighted, with the book by Donald Knuth referenced. The pros and cons of markup languages and WYSIWYG text formats is effectively discussed. The importance of good graphical work is reviewed, while highlighting the key differences between vector and raster images. A nice summery at the end ties the piece together. The text is slightly over the word count (by 23 words) but not enough to penalise. The text reads reasonably well, with a nice variety in sentence structure.

A decent summery of the lecture. The importance of a good abstract to the MSc project is highlighted and examples of how to improve them is provided. The advantages of using mark-up languages, such as LaTeX, over WYSIWGY programs, such as Microsoft Word are discussed well. The importance of good use of graphics is also well covered, with multiple formats being highlighted, such as in publications, PowerPoint presentations, and scientific posters. The text is within the 500-word limit. The text reads well, with a good variety to sentence structures and lengths. Good work overall.
