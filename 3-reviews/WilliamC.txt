Instructions:

------------


1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:


- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in 		my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?

- Does the text read well?
- Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?

- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, 	so it should be possible for an overseas student to get the best score!


2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.



3. Upload this assessment.txt file to Moodle.

This abstract is generally easy to understand, with some variation in sentence length and concise description in parts 
but not consistently throughout. The content of the lecture is covered at length, though perhaps to the detriment of 
the word count, which has crept up over the 500 word limit by around 50 words. This could perhaps be remedied by using 
less of a narrative tone, which isn't always conducive to concision. The structure of the abstract is also slightly clunky, 
but generally useful for conveying the key content of the lecture. On the whole, the abstract reads fluently.

This abstract is quite difficult to read: a lack of concision seems to be the main issue, though the "wingdings" present
 throughout the text (though likely unintended) compound this somewhat. Much of the lecture content seems to be covered in good detail but occasionally
 in the form of clunky lists. The word count is comfortably below 500 words. Sentence lengths are generally well-varied. Overall,
the abstract covers the necessary content but could be more fluently written.

The abstract doesn't seem to cover the majority of the lecture content, as there is no mention of graphics, poster presentations, 
writing exercises or typesetting. Despite this, the abstract is exactly 500 words long. Greater concision would be beneficial, as 
a wider range of lecture content could be included whilst remaining within the word limit. The abstract reads fluently, though would 
benefit also from greater variation in sentence length, which is currently quite limited and makes the abstract feel "heavy". However,
the content of the abstract is easy to understand.

A very concise, fluent and clear abstract with lots of variation in sentence length. Much of the lecture content is covered in a logical 
manner. The structure of the abstract is also proportionate with regards to the amount of time we spent discussing each aspect of 
effective scientific communication during the lecture. The word count is appropriate as it is just under 500 words. The abstract could perhaps 
conclude with some comments on the wider implications of the lecture content on our own scientific writing (e.g. for our research projects).

The abstract covers most of the lecture content but tends to omit finer details, despite only being ~300 words long; 
inclusion of finer detail would also make the abstract easier to understand. It reads fairly fluently, but some content, 
especially that on graphics, could be expressed with more concision (e.g. try to concatenate sentences with similar meanings). 
Sentence length variation could also be improved, as most sentences are roughly the same length. Overall, the abstract has a 
fairly logical structure, which aids in understanding the content.
