Instructions:
------------

1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.

3. Upload this assessment.txt file to Moodle.

The use of the first-person (e.g. 'we') should be avoided.
The sentences are of appropriate and varied lengths, helping to make the abstract easy to read.
The core content is included, though the coverage of it should be more concise at times.
100% of the word count has been used, which is positive.

Rank: 3/5

Feedback:

The abstract is too short.
The lack of use of 40% of the available word count means that core content, especially concerning scientific report writing, hasn't always received sufficient attention.
The sentences are of appropriate and varied lengths.
When core content is covered, the coverage is appropriately concise.
Some sentences are ambiguous, which makes the abstract slightly difficult to read at times.

Rank: 3/5

Feedback:

Some of the core content is included, but almost 30% of the word limit hasn't been used.
Some of the sentences are too long, making the abstract difficult to read at times.
Abstracts shouldn't contain directions for further reading outside of their attached paper.
Most of the coverage of core content is appropriately concise.
Coverage of the basics of scientifc report writing should be more extensive.

Feedback: 
--------

The core content is included, but 20% of the word limit hasn't been used.
The sentences are of appropriate and varied lengths, helping to make the abstract easy to read.
Coverage of the content is generally concise.
There is too much detail in some sections, particularly when individual references are mentioned.  Abstracts shouldn't contain their own list of references.
There are some non-standard choices of word, such as the use of 'speculate'; which could lead to some confusion upon reading the abstract.

Rank: 3/5

Feedback:

The abstract uses up almost all of the word limit, making it of a good length.
Some core content is included, though there isn't enough detail about the structure of a scientific paper.
Many points are made concisely, in sentences broadly of appropriate and varied lengths.
A number of sentences don't make sense, making the abstract difficult to read at times.
The use of the first-person (e.g. 'our') should be avoided.
