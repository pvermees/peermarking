Instructions:
------------

1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.

3. Upload this assessment.txt file to Moodle.

- Overview of information, introduction in to what is overviewed
- Shows understanding referring to Structure of a Scientific Paper, alongside Mathematical Writing and Visual Display of Quantitative Information 
- Graphics covered in great depth, Mathematical Writing could be referred to more if it is deemed to be important and thus is worth more than a brief mention 
- Quite often throughout the paper it is told what will be covered later on in the paper, this is unnecessary as this was mentioned in the brief introduction 
- Word Count: 523
- Reads well although sections could flow better

Rank: 5/5

Feedback: 
--------

- Overview of information, details each component and aspect needed in a research paper - regarding structure, provides a brief overview of each section and what it should entail 
- Brief discussion of graphics, and another mention of graphics following a statement on Donald Knuth's work, which does not seem relevant in the context and thus should have been referred to more than just a brief mention. Also, it questions why the two graphic sections could not be linked together in order to aid a better flow of the paper?
- Word Count: 494
- The flow and overall read of the paper seems almost like bullet points and separate sections, but the content is very good
