Dr Pieter Vermeesch introduced himself as the lecturer for Research Methods. He outlined good scientific writing. Throughout, Dr Pieter gave resources by K. K. Landes, Donald Knuth, and Edward Tufte as guidance for good report writing.
A paper should have nine sections: main title, abstract, introduction, scientific methods, results, a discussion, conclusion, acknowledgements, and references. Dr Pieter concluded most readers only have time for, or can access, the abstract so we focused on writing a good one. From the abstract, the reader should be able to reproduce the experiment. We give results for this to be possible. We concluded an abstract should be self-contained so the reader can obtain any crucial information from just the abstract. 
The title is another section always accessible to the reader; therefore, it should be catchy and contain keywords from the experiment. The introduction should contain background information so the reader has context for the experiment. It should also outline the content of the paper. The methods section includes the experimental procedure so others can reproduce it. The results section should be as objective as possible. We state results without interpreting them or their significance. When stating results, we include error propagation and uncertainties in our numbers. In the discussion, we comment on the relevance of our results and reach scientific conclusions. With the conclusion, we discuss possible experiment improvements, including how to avoid mistakes. We should also include an extension so others can contribute to our work. After the scientific sections, we include an acknowledgments section to thank who helped with the paper but is not a co-author.  This includes any organization that funded our research. Finally, we cite our sources. Different journals use different referencing styles, but we can change styles with a reference manager. Dr Pieter says he prefers the Harvard style but this is not mandatory as long as we are consistent in style. Regardless, we should not include URLs in the bibliography. URLs have a short lifetime and might not be around when someone wants to follow our sources. However, printed material is forever. 
Next, Dr Pieter gave writing tips. Write simply so the audience can keep up with the discussion. Over-complicating does not attract readers and seems like the writer cannot communicate properly. Write as if speaking aloud. This guarantees sentence variation and better flow. 
Dr Pieter then gave advice on software to write papers with and to edit images. With WYSIWYG programs, what we write onscreen is the final product. They rely on manual input and last minute additions can lead to un-formatting chaos. Markup languages are friendlier. They use input code to output a separate final document, keeping everything organized. With images, use raster programs to edit photographs and vector programs to make graphics. Vector programs produce sharp images with small file size. When creating graphics, consider the crucial factor of ink to information ratio. Do not waste ink on a graphic showing little information. Annotate relevant data points and avoid displaying 3D diagrams on paper.

There isn’t a single correct way to write a good scientific paper or report.  However, most published scientific papers contain a common set of sections, following roughly the same outline as each other.  In chronological order, these are as follows. First, there is a title, which summarises the contents of the paper to attract the attention of potential readers.  Below the title, there is an abstract, arguably the most important part of the paper.  Ideally not written in the passive voice, the abstract concentrates and condenses in itself the essential information of the paper.  It doesn’t simply recite the subjects covered by the paper, like some sort of heavily expanded version of the title.  After its abstract, a scientific paper has an Introduction section; which both outlines the structured contents of the paper and includes a brief literature review justifying a set of research questions (and often hypotheses).  Then, there is a Methods section; which provides a sufficient level of technical detail for other researchers to follow in order to reproduce the results of the paper when answering the research questions.  After the Methods section, the results of the study presented in the scientific paper are detailed in a dedicated Results section.  Here, the data themselves (so-called ‘dry facts’) and analysis of them (in the form of statistics) are presented separately; with the former being detailed first.  Next, the scientific significance of the data is inferred in the Discussion section; which draws upon both the data themselves (and statistical analysis of them) and existing literature detailed in the literature review of the Introduction section.  After the Discussion section, a Conclusions section summarises the main findings of the paper, responding to the research questions and outlining the contribution made by the paper to scientific knowledge.  The Conclusions section can include suggestions for future research.   Then, there is a short Acknowledgements section, which thanks any funding agencies, research supervisors, reviewers and others who have contributed to the research but are not co-authors on the paper.  Finally, there is a References section, which follows a set format and only includes proper academic references (e.g. books and journal articles).  Individual papers may include other sections, such as a List of Figures (or Tables) and Appendices.  However, such sections are not always essential.

In following the outline above, a good scientific paper, to paraphrase Albert Einstein, explains everything as simply as possible, but not simpler.  Such a paper uses snappy titles, arresting first sentences and lucid initial paragraphs, amongst other devices, to attract the attention of readers.  When writing a good scientific paper, the author puts themselves in the reader’s place, so that they ensure that the latter understands what is written.  In such a paper, appropriate pacing is ensured by variations in sentence length, whilst frequent repetition of words is avoided; often by reading sections aloud to identify over-uses.  Existing material incorporated into a scientific paper should always be re-written for the new context.  Effective use of both drafting and editing is also important.

Today's lecture talks about how to write scientific report.

Dr Pieter Vermeesch began the lecture by presenting general guidelines to write a good scientific paper. 
Most scientific papers and reports follow approximately the same outlines in each part: title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments and references.
Among them, Abstract is arguably the most important part of the paper. K.K. Landes¡¯s paper ¡°Scrutiny of an Abstract¡± further touches upon the importance of abstract: The abstract is read much more times than the entire article. It should not be a mere recital of the subjects covered. The abstract should be a condensation and concentration of the essential information in the paper.


Subsequently£¬Dr Pieter provided some writing skills mentioned in a book called ¡°Mathematical Writing¡±. For example, you should break down complex things into parts and then explain each part; attract the attention of the reader; keep rewriting the article.


In the next part of today¡¯s lecture, 14 useful methods about how to practice writing are shown£ºPractice replacing three words in a sentence without changing the meaning of the sentence; replacing the grammar of the sentence without changing the meaning of the sentence; writing a nonsense that is complete but meaningless; constructing the food you like to eat only by appearance; writing definitions for common words and compare it with the definition in the dictionary; try to write an article rather than type; etc.


Thirdly, Dr Pieter introduced two ways of typesetting: WYSIWYG and markup language. Popular text editing programs such as Microsoft Word follow a ¡°WYSIWYG¡± design, which stands for ¡°What You See Is What You Get¡±. These programs are more user-friendly.  Alternatively, markup languages such as L ATEX and HTML require editing of code in a text editor and rendered in a separate application.
WYSIWYG editors may be easier to learn than markup languages. But the latter often prove to be superior for anything longer and more complicated than a few pages of text.


Next, Dr Pieter gave some examples of efective graphics and bad graphics. An excellent graph should give viewer greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with least ink.

After that, this lecture taught us how to make effective graphics.
1.ink-to-information ratio. It is better to add some annotations made of ¡®informative ink¡¯ to distract attention on the data.
2.¡®Chart junk¡¯. Make the chart clear and effective.
3.Vector vs. raster graphics. Two fundamentally different types of graphics can be chosen: Vector graphics¡ªefficiently display£¬compact in size£¬have infinite spatial resolution£»Raster graphics¡ª¡ª pixelated images£¬ only be used for photographs£¬tend to be larger in size and are pixelated when magnified.


To conclude, this is an excellent lecture to let us know how to write a good scientific report.

Understanding the qualities of a good scientific report is a fundamental element of scientific writing. There are certain methods that will not only improve the quality of a report but will help to hold the attention of your intended audience. Most scientific papers follow the same general outline, however the title, abstract and methodology should receive significant attention, with most people reading the abstract over any other part of the paper. The majority of the audience may only read the abstract, therefore this section should be informative, concise and should act as a summary of the findings of a report.  This indicates that great care should be taken over the writing style used in scientific reports, and it is recommended to develop one’s technique by practising writing exercises. Donald E. Knuth’s 1996 book ‘Mathematical Writing’, presents a constructive set of exercises designed to aid and improve technical writing.
There are two contrasting paradigms for typesetting a scientific report: user-friendly WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) programs such as Microsoft Word, or Mark-up languages; text processing tools which display code openly, such as LaTeX. The length and complexity of the report should determine the writer’s choice of program, with Mark-up languages possessing considerable advantages if a report includes equations or requires significant formatting. 
The choice and quality of graphics is of great importance, in order to quickly convey key information in a scientific report. Therefore, it is essential to select the most appropriate digital format for any figures and diagrams. Vector formats are recommended if displaying mathematical diagrams, graphs or drawings, however when touching up photographs, raster formats are more suitable to avoid pixilation. It is also important to avoid ‘chart junk’, unnecessary visual elements added by software that can overcrowd the diagram and confuse the reader, and to keep a low ink-to-information ratio.  In order to communicate information effectively, only the minimum set of visuals should be used, especially if presenting graphic heavy work such as posters. 
These suggestions should be practised for future pieces of scientific writing in order to improve the report quality, to appeal to a wider audience and to promote the success of a scientific paper.

Since master of science students are future scientists, principal training on written and visual 
expression of academic works is crucial part of post-graduate courses. The first lecture of 
Research Methods Module (GEOL0037) in Department of Earth Science, University College 
London (UCL) fundamentally presents communication in science. The main aim of the first 
lecture is the introduction of the course schedule and instructs guiding information which will 
be useful not only dissertation process, but also eventual scientific works of the current 
master students. Here the lecturer shows, through analysis of scientific papers, reports or 
theses, they ensue the same outline respectively: title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, 
discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments and references, whereas abstract, which includes 
the "essential information" (Landes, 1966, p. 1992), is the most important section of a paper, 
article or thesis. Comparisons of different types of text editing computer programs show that 
markup language is more beneficial than What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) 
design. Besides written works, graphical or visual expression is the second most important 
part of academic works. Graphical excellence eliminates complexity of ideas and long 
comprehension time in modest space. Using visual expressions in studies is not sufficient 
independently. Unmeasured or unnecessary graphical expressions affects reliability of these 
studies. Inattentive designed charts cause distraction of audiences or readers. Preparing of 
effective visuals is possible with vector graphics rather than raster graphics because of 
unlimited spatial resolution. The lecture also includes a parody PowerPoint presentation 
which is intentionally made instead of tedious method in order to show the conceptual style 
of academic presentation. Analysis of prevalent mistakes on a real PowerPoint slide 
illustrates main points to consider. Despite PowerPoint presentation, poster presentation is 
another aspect of scientific communication. The key point of the making an effective research 
poster is concentrate entire study with graphical excellence in systematic structure.
