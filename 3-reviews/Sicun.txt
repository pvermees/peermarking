Instructions:
------------

1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.

3. Upload this assessment.txt file to Moodle.

 1. It can be understood well and has covered most of the lecture.
 2. Sentences are understandable and not hard to read.
 3. It has a structure of deduction but not so clear in the end, that some paragraphs might seem separated from the centre idea.
 4. It is not true that most people do not read beyond the abstract. In my opinion is that people would read the abstract carefully to get the key information and then decide if they would keep reading the paper or not. It would be a rare case that people only have access to the abstract and try to understand the project by reading abstract only.
 5. Some conceptions might be better if they are presented with some simple explanations, like 'ink ratio'.
 6. Did not exceed the word limit.

 5. Some passages are monotonous.
