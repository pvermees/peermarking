Instructions:
------------

1. Rank the submissions from 1 to  5  based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.

3. Upload this assessment.txt file to Moodle.

Rank: 2/5

Feedback: 
The text does stay within 500 words limit.
The abstract generally summarizes the lecture of Science Report Writing.
But some sentences are too oral, expressions need to be more academic.
Also need to give a general coclusion at the end of the abstract.
Overall, it is very clear to read and understant what the writer wants to express and some sentences show the well understanding of specific knowledage.

Rank: 1/5

Feedback: 
The abstract shows enough essential information of the lecture.
There are some variations in sentence length but the expression is still too oral.
Some parts discussed in the abstract is too detailed and can be simplified (eg, structure of paper follows: title, abstract, intro ...etc).
Still need a summarized sentence at the end of the abstract.
There are some own understandings of the knowledge and you generally write concisely, which is good.

The number of words is far from 500 but shows a clear and logical structure.
Most of the information is clear and well presented which helps reader to understand easily.
Good use of variations in sentence length.
It is easy to get an idea of waht the abstract is talking about but some information can be discussed broadly.
Overall, this abtract is decent but need extra rewriting and modification.
