Instructions:
------------

1. Rank the submissions from 1 to 5 based on the criteria set out in the notes, including:
- Is the abstract a condensation and concentration of the essential information in my presentation?
- Does the text stay within the 500 word limit?
- Does the text read well? Is there sufficient variation in sentence length?
- Can you understand the text? Does it sound right when you read it out loud?
- ...

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that not everyone is a native English speaker.
  Try not to penalise people for basic grammatical and language errors.
  This is not an English test, so it should be possible for an overseas 
  student to get the best score!

2. Provide at least 5 lines of feedback based on the above criteria.

3. Upload this feedback.txt file to Moodle.
